Transformer-CNN Hybrids:

SwinUNet (hierarchical vision transformers) for global cloud patterns + local edges.

Mask2Former (panoptic segmentation) to separate overlapping clouds.

Diffusion Models:

Train a Stable Diffusion variant conditioned on atmospheric data (pressure, humidity) for probabilistic cloud generation.

3. Physics-Guided AI
Loss Functions:

Add meteorological constraints (e.g., penalize predictions violating adiabatic lapse rates).

Differentiable Physics:

Embed PySDK (Pythonic weather modeling) into the training loop.

4. Real-Time Edge Deployment
Quantized Models:

Deploy TinyML versions (e.g., 8-bit quantized U-Net) on drones/satellites.

Neuromorphic Chips:

Use Loihi 2 for event-based processing of cloud motion.

5. Human-AI Collaboration
Active Learning:

Train a BERT-based QA system to query meteorologists about ambiguous samples.

Explainability:

SHAP values + attention maps to show why the AI flagged a cluster.
